# ngrok-discord-wrapper

This project is a wrapper for the ngrok application, which has the ability to send the created tunnel link via a discord webhook

To configure the wrapper and ngrok, move into the directory where the wrapper and ngrok executable are in and run the following commands:
  ./ngrok-wrapper
  ./ngrok-wrapper --configure
  
The first command will ask you for a Discord Webhook URL and the second one will ask you for your ngrok authtoken
